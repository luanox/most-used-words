1
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:32,405
<i>Lumos Maxima.</i>

2
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:37,254
<i>Lumos Maxima.</i>

3
00:00:56,535 --> 00:00:58,093
<i>Lumos Maxima.</i>

4
00:01:00,255 --> 00:01:02,086
<i>Lumos Maxima.</i>

5
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:05,806
<i>Lumos Maxima!</i>

6
00:01:34,015 --> 00:01:35,528
Harry. Harry.

7
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,606
Harry, open the door.

8
00:01:44,215 --> 00:01:46,445
Marge. How lovely to see...

9
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:49,886
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.

10
00:01:50,055 --> 00:01:51,329
What is it?

11
00:01:51,495 --> 00:01:53,531
Nothing. School stuff.

12
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:56,255
Later perhaps, if you behave.

13
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:58,531
I will if she does.

14
00:01:58,695 --> 00:02:01,687
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.

15
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:04,609
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.

16
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:06,652
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.

17
00:02:06,815 --> 00:02:10,967
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

18
00:02:11,135 --> 00:02:15,333
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?

19
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:17,213
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

20
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,570
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.

21
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:21,612
Okay.

22
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:27,608
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

23
00:02:28,575 --> 00:02:31,408
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.

24
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:34,448
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

25
00:02:35,015 --> 00:02:36,926
A bit more.

26
00:02:37,455 --> 00:02:40,606
Usually just a fry-up for me,
what with 12 dogs.

27
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:43,283
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

28
00:02:46,255 --> 00:02:48,166
You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?

29
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:52,214
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

30
00:02:53,655 --> 00:02:55,373
What are you smirking at?

31
00:02:55,535 --> 00:02:57,287
Where did you send the boy,
Vernon?

32
00:02:57,495 --> 00:03:00,646
St. Brutus'. It's a fine
institution for hopeless cases.

33
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:03,693
Do they use a cane
at St. Brutus', boy?

34
00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:08,289
Oh, yeah.

35
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:11,055
Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.

36
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:13,683
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby...

37
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:16,887
...wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.

38
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:20,047
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.

39
00:03:20,215 --> 00:03:23,969
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.

40
00:03:24,135 --> 00:03:26,205
What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?

41
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,253
Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.

42
00:03:29,415 --> 00:03:32,134
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.

43
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,729
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.

44
00:03:37,615 --> 00:03:41,528
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.

45
00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:43,447
I think it's time you went to bed.

46
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:46,732
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

47
00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:50,933
Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.

48
00:03:51,135 --> 00:03:54,730
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.

49
00:03:54,895 --> 00:03:58,774
If something's wrong with the bitch,
then something's wrong with the pup.

50
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:00,567
Shut up! Shut up!

51
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,047
Right.

52
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:09,251
Let me tell you...

53
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:31,851
Vernon!

54
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,493
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

55
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:20,086
Stop!

56
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:25,009
I've got you, Marge. I've got you.

57
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:30,212
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.

58
00:05:31,455 --> 00:05:33,173
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.

59
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,087
Oh, Vernon.

60
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:37,927
Oh, God.

61
00:05:38,095 --> 00:05:39,813
Marge!

62
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:48,691
Please!

63
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:51,411
Marge!

64
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:55,492
Come back!

65
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:20,804
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.

66
00:06:20,975 --> 00:06:24,092
- You put her right!
- No. She deserved what she got.

67
00:06:24,535 --> 00:06:27,527
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.

68
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:30,613
- Yeah? Try me.
- They won't let you back now.

69
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:32,049
You've nowhere to go.

70
00:06:32,215 --> 00:06:34,445
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.

71
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,407
"Welcome to the Knight Bus...

72
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:11,806
...emergency transport
for the stranded witch or wizard.

73
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:16,730
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor for this evening."

74
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:21,688
What you doing down there?

75
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:24,485
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?

76
00:08:24,695 --> 00:08:27,255
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.

77
00:08:27,455 --> 00:08:29,525
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

78
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,287
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.

79
00:08:39,455 --> 00:08:41,127
Well, come on, then. In.

80
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:44,014
No, no, no. I'll get this.
You get in.

81
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:50,891
Come on.

82
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,014
Come on. Move on, move on.

83
00:09:17,175 --> 00:09:20,292
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

84
00:09:20,455 --> 00:09:22,605
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

85
00:09:32,855 --> 00:09:36,006
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.

86
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:40,488
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

87
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:43,493
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."

88
00:09:43,655 --> 00:09:45,885
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup...

89
00:09:46,055 --> 00:09:48,728
...make sure you eat it
before it eats you.

90
00:09:52,015 --> 00:09:54,529
- But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
- Muggles?

91
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,367
They don't see nothing, do they?

92
00:09:56,535 --> 00:09:58,969
No, but if you jab them
with a fork, they feel.

93
00:10:00,655 --> 00:10:03,567
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!

94
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:14,409
Ten, nine, eight...

95
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,209
...seven, six, five...

96
00:10:17,415 --> 00:10:19,565
...four, three, three and a half...

97
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,493
...two, one and three quarters.

98
00:10:22,015 --> 00:10:23,573
Yes!

99
00:10:27,735 --> 00:10:29,054
Who is that?

100
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:31,530
That man.

101
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:34,853
Who is that?

102
00:10:35,055 --> 00:10:36,488
Who is...?

103
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:38,970
That is Sirius Black, that is.

104
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:42,652
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.

105
00:10:43,895 --> 00:10:46,090
He's a murderer.

106
00:10:46,255 --> 00:10:48,769
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.

107
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,691
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?

108
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:54,732
He's the first one that done it.

109
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,169
He was a big supporter of...

110
00:10:58,655 --> 00:11:00,088
...You-Know-Who.

111
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:02,572
I reckon you've heard of him.

112
00:11:02,735 --> 00:11:04,248
Yeah.

113
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:05,689
Him I've heard of.

114
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:10,815
Ernie, two double-deckers
at 12 o'clock.

115
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,887
They're getting closer, Ernie.

116
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:15,805
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

117
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:25,204
Mind your head.

118
00:11:29,895 --> 00:11:31,772
Hey, guys? Guys?

119
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:34,045
Why the long faces?

120
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:41,964
Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.

121
00:11:47,215 --> 00:11:50,446
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

122
00:11:51,735 --> 00:11:54,295
Mr. Potter, at last.

123
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,769
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!

124
00:12:22,015 --> 00:12:23,767
Room 11.

125
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:27,529
Hedwig.

126
00:12:27,695 --> 00:12:30,414
Right smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.

127
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:34,124
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.

128
00:12:35,975 --> 00:12:39,445
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty
to inform you, Mr. Potter...

129
00:12:39,615 --> 00:12:42,687
...earlier this evening
your uncle's sister was located...

130
00:12:42,855 --> 00:12:46,643
...a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.

131
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:50,410
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.

132
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:55,171
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.

133
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,846
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.

134
00:13:00,015 --> 00:13:02,483
So that's that...

135
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:05,408
...and no harm done.

136
00:13:06,055 --> 00:13:07,329
Pea soup?

137
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,531
No, thank you.

138
00:13:09,695 --> 00:13:11,811
- Minister?
- Yes?

139
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:13,647
- I don't understand.
- Understand?

140
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:17,245
I broke the law. Underage wizards
can't use magic at home.

141
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:20,333
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban...

142
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:22,929
...for blowing up their aunts.

143
00:13:26,735 --> 00:13:31,092
On the other hand, running away
like that, given the state of things...

144
00:13:31,255 --> 00:13:33,610
...was very, very irresponsible.

145
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:37,444
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.

146
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:39,367
Sirius Black, you mean?

147
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:41,207
But what's he got to do with me?

148
00:13:43,415 --> 00:13:48,045
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.

149
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:51,247
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.

150
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:54,248
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...

151
00:13:54,415 --> 00:13:58,249
...of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.

152
00:14:02,855 --> 00:14:04,129
Hedwig.

153
00:14:04,455 --> 00:14:09,165
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't...

154
00:14:09,455 --> 00:14:11,810
...wander.

155
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:16,088
Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?

156
00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:33,611
Housekeeping.

157
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,045
I'll come back later.

158
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:47,688
I'm warning you, Hermione.

159
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:51,404
Keep that beast away from Scabbers,
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

160
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,566
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?

161
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:56,613
- It's in his nature.
- A cat? Is that what they told you?

162
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:59,209
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...

163
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,809
...coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

164
00:16:01,975 --> 00:16:04,284
Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.

165
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:06,008
Harry.

166
00:16:07,055 --> 00:16:08,408
Harry.

167
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,493
- Egypt. What's it like?
- Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...

168
00:16:12,695 --> 00:16:15,892
...like mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

169
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:19,132
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.

170
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:22,332
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.

171
00:16:22,495 --> 00:16:24,804
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

172
00:16:24,975 --> 00:16:26,328
- The day maid.
- Night maid.

173
00:16:26,495 --> 00:16:28,531
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.

174
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:30,048
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

175
00:16:30,215 --> 00:16:32,285
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.

176
00:16:32,455 --> 00:16:33,729
- Got everything?
- Yes.

177
00:16:33,895 --> 00:16:35,965
- Yes? All your books?
- It's all upstairs.

178
00:16:36,135 --> 00:16:37,488
- Your clothes?
- Everything.

179
00:16:37,655 --> 00:16:39,008
- Good boy.
- Thank you.

180
00:16:39,175 --> 00:16:40,972
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.

181
00:16:41,135 --> 00:16:44,491
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.

182
00:16:44,695 --> 00:16:47,209
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

183
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,845
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah. It should be great.

184
00:16:53,815 --> 00:16:57,490
Harry, some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...

185
00:16:57,655 --> 00:17:00,215
...from divulging what I'm about
to reveal to you.

186
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,572
But I think that you need
to know the facts.

187
00:17:03,735 --> 00:17:06,203
You are in danger.

188
00:17:06,855 --> 00:17:09,210
Grave danger.

189
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,209
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?

190
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:15,290
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?

191
00:17:15,455 --> 00:17:19,004
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?

192
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:22,368
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped...

193
00:17:22,535 --> 00:17:24,287
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.

194
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:25,729
Sorry.

195
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:28,693
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

196
00:17:28,855 --> 00:17:30,413
...Black lost everything.

197
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:34,693
But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.

198
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:36,925
And in his mind...

199
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:39,973
...you are the only thing
that stands in the way...

200
00:17:40,135 --> 00:17:43,730
...of You-Know-Who
returning to power.

201
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:45,965
And that is why...

202
00:17:46,135 --> 00:17:48,569
...he has escaped from Azkaban.

203
00:17:48,895 --> 00:17:50,533
To find you.

204
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:53,493
And kill me.

205
00:17:54,415 --> 00:17:56,975
Harry, swear to me
that whatever you might hear...

206
00:17:57,135 --> 00:17:59,569
...you won't go looking for Black.

207
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:01,209
Mr. Weasley...

208
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:05,209
...why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

209
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:07,533
Quick. Quick.

210
00:18:07,815 --> 00:18:09,567
Ron, Ron!

211
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,246
Oh, for goodness' sake!

212
00:18:12,455 --> 00:18:14,810
Don't lose him!

213
00:18:15,815 --> 00:18:17,806
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...

214
00:18:17,975 --> 00:18:20,330
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.

215
00:18:20,495 --> 00:18:23,931
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

216
00:18:24,095 --> 00:18:25,767
I was lucky not to be arrested.

217
00:18:25,935 --> 00:18:27,891
I still think it was brilliant.

218
00:18:28,455 --> 00:18:30,685
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

219
00:18:33,415 --> 00:18:34,734
Who do you think that is?

220
00:18:34,895 --> 00:18:37,648
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?

221
00:18:37,815 --> 00:18:39,851
How is it she knows everything?

222
00:18:40,015 --> 00:18:43,007
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.

223
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:46,446
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be. Why?

224
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:50,131
I gotta tell you something.

225
00:19:02,815 --> 00:19:06,012
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...

226
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:07,927
...to come after you?
- Yeah.

227
00:19:08,095 --> 00:19:10,006
But they'll catch Black, won't they?

228
00:19:10,175 --> 00:19:12,769
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.

229
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:16,132
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before...

230
00:19:16,295 --> 00:19:20,129
...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.

231
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,093
Why are we stopping?

232
00:19:24,095 --> 00:19:25,767
We can't be there yet.

233
00:19:29,855 --> 00:19:31,971
What's going on?

234
00:19:32,175 --> 00:19:34,735
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.

235
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,805
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

236
00:19:39,655 --> 00:19:41,486
There's something moving out there.

237
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:57,447
I think someone's coming aboard.

238
00:20:21,615 --> 00:20:24,368
Bloody hell! What's happening?

239
00:21:33,695 --> 00:21:35,048
Harry.

240
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:37,847
Harry, are you all right?

241
00:21:43,775 --> 00:21:45,367
Thank you.

242
00:21:46,495 --> 00:21:48,850
Here, eat this. It'll help.

243
00:21:49,335 --> 00:21:51,371
It's all right. It's chocolate.

244
00:21:57,415 --> 00:21:59,406
What was that thing that came?

245
00:21:59,575 --> 00:22:02,851
It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. It's gone now.

246
00:22:03,015 --> 00:22:05,609
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.

247
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:09,245
If you'll excuse me, I need to have
a little word with the driver.

248
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:16,453
Eat. You'll feel better.

249
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:23,289
What happened to me?

250
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:25,127
Well, you sort of went rigid.

251
00:22:25,295 --> 00:22:28,332
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.

252
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,733
And did either of you two...

253
00:22:31,895 --> 00:22:33,169
...you know...

254
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:36,293
...pass out?
- No.

255
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,093
I felt weird, though.

256
00:22:38,255 --> 00:22:40,007
Like I'd never be cheerful again.

257
00:22:41,215 --> 00:22:43,331
But someone was screaming.

258
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,814
A woman.

259
00:22:45,735 --> 00:22:47,646
No one was screaming, Harry.

260
00:23:44,415 --> 00:23:48,010
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.

261
00:23:48,215 --> 00:23:50,171
Now, I'd like to say a few words...

262
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:54,487
...before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.

263
00:23:54,655 --> 00:23:57,772
First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...

264
00:23:57,975 --> 00:24:00,284
...who's kindly consented
to fill the post...

265
00:24:00,495 --> 00:24:02,850
...of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.

266
00:24:03,015 --> 00:24:05,449
Good luck, professor.

267
00:24:09,855 --> 00:24:13,052
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.

268
00:24:13,215 --> 00:24:15,775
Potter. Is it true you fainted?

269
00:24:16,575 --> 00:24:19,453
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.

270
00:24:19,615 --> 00:24:21,526
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.

271
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:23,970
Our Care of Magical Creatures
teacher...

272
00:24:24,175 --> 00:24:25,972
...has decided to retire...

273
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:29,730
...in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.

274
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,529
Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...

275
00:24:32,695 --> 00:24:35,414
...that his place will be taken
by none other...

276
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:39,727
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

277
00:24:50,535 --> 00:24:53,208
Finally, on a more disquieting note...

278
00:24:53,415 --> 00:24:55,804
...at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...

279
00:24:56,015 --> 00:25:00,964
...Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

280
00:25:01,615 --> 00:25:04,925
...until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.

281
00:25:05,855 --> 00:25:09,370
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.

282
00:25:09,535 --> 00:25:11,127
Now whilst I've been assured...

283
00:25:11,295 --> 00:25:14,810
...that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...

284
00:25:14,975 --> 00:25:16,249
...a word of caution.

285
00:25:16,455 --> 00:25:19,492
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...

286
00:25:19,655 --> 00:25:22,931
...between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.

287
00:25:23,095 --> 00:25:26,565
Therefore, I must warn
each and every one of you...

288
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:30,205
...to give them no reason
to harm you.

289
00:25:30,935 --> 00:25:35,850
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.

290
00:25:37,895 --> 00:25:41,046
But you know,
happiness can be found...

291
00:25:41,215 --> 00:25:44,685
...even in the darkest of times...

292
00:25:45,855 --> 00:25:49,564
...if one only remembers
to turn on the light.

293
00:26:01,095 --> 00:26:03,006
<i>Fortuna Major</i>.

294
00:26:05,735 --> 00:26:08,295
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.

295
00:26:08,495 --> 00:26:11,293
- <i>Fortuna Major.</i>
- No, no. Wait, wait.

296
00:26:11,455 --> 00:26:13,207
Watch this.

297
00:26:23,535 --> 00:26:28,290
- Amazing. Just with my voice.
- <i>Fortuna Major</i>.

298
00:26:28,495 --> 00:26:31,885
- Yes, all right. Go in.
- Thank you.

299
00:26:33,815 --> 00:26:35,726
Still doing that after three years.

300
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:37,965
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.

301
00:26:39,135 --> 00:26:41,205
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

302
00:26:42,215 --> 00:26:43,534
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.

303
00:26:44,455 --> 00:26:46,525
Green. That's a monkey.

304
00:26:48,255 --> 00:26:50,815
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?

305
00:26:50,975 --> 00:26:53,091
Do not give him one again.

306
00:26:53,255 --> 00:26:55,769
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

307
00:27:02,575 --> 00:27:04,247
- Ron, catch.
- I will.

308
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:11,253
I think we have a winner.

309
00:27:12,175 --> 00:27:14,405
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.

310
00:27:15,015 --> 00:27:17,404
Look at him. His face.

311
00:27:59,255 --> 00:28:01,405
<i>Welcome, my children.</i>

312
00:28:01,615 --> 00:28:06,484
In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.

313
00:28:06,655 --> 00:28:11,729
In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.

314
00:28:13,095 --> 00:28:16,883
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

315
00:28:17,055 --> 00:28:21,492
Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.

316
00:28:21,695 --> 00:28:25,370
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,
the art of reading tea leaves.

317
00:28:25,535 --> 00:28:28,971
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.

318
00:28:29,455 --> 00:28:30,774
What do you see?

319
00:28:30,935 --> 00:28:36,373
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.

320
00:28:36,575 --> 00:28:38,884
But first, you must broaden
your minds.

321
00:28:39,055 --> 00:28:43,412
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.

322
00:28:43,575 --> 00:28:45,406
- Where did you come from?
- Me?

323
00:28:45,575 --> 00:28:48,135
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...

324
00:28:48,295 --> 00:28:50,490
Is your grandmother quite well?

325
00:28:51,135 --> 00:28:52,534
I think so.

326
00:28:52,695 --> 00:28:55,368
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.

327
00:28:58,255 --> 00:28:59,574
Pity.

328
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:02,289
Broaden your minds.

329
00:29:05,735 --> 00:29:08,932
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?

330
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:10,926
- I think you are.
- Sure.

331
00:29:11,135 --> 00:29:13,251
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.

332
00:29:13,415 --> 00:29:15,053
Yeah.

333
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:20,087
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.

334
00:29:20,535 --> 00:29:24,005
And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.

335
00:29:24,215 --> 00:29:25,489
So...

336
00:29:25,655 --> 00:29:29,534
...you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.

337
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:31,009
Give me the cup.

338
00:29:33,495 --> 00:29:35,292
Oh, my dear boy.

339
00:29:37,295 --> 00:29:38,887
My dear...

340
00:29:40,495 --> 00:29:43,453
...you have the Grim.

341
00:29:44,255 --> 00:29:45,927
The Grin? What's the Grin?

342
00:29:46,095 --> 00:29:48,848
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

343
00:29:49,015 --> 00:29:51,085
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

344
00:29:51,295 --> 00:29:53,650
It's among the darkest omens
in our world.

345
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:55,767
It's an omen...

346
00:29:55,935 --> 00:29:57,687
...of death."

347
00:30:02,015 --> 00:30:05,690
You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black?

348
00:30:05,855 --> 00:30:09,643
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination's a woolly discipline.

349
00:30:09,815 --> 00:30:13,330
Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.

350
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:16,487
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking?

351
00:30:16,655 --> 00:30:18,247
A fair few.

352
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:20,406
Hang on. That's not possible.

353
00:30:20,575 --> 00:30:23,248
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.

354
00:30:23,415 --> 00:30:25,326
You have to be in two
classes at once.

355
00:30:25,495 --> 00:30:28,726
Don't be silly. How could anyone
be in two classes at once?

356
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:32,968
"Broaden your minds. Use your
Inner Eye to see the future."

357
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:37,883
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.

358
00:30:38,055 --> 00:30:39,807
I got a real treat for you today.

359
00:30:39,975 --> 00:30:41,886
A great lesson. So follow me.

360
00:30:52,695 --> 00:30:55,653
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.

361
00:30:55,815 --> 00:30:58,204
And open your books to page 49.

362
00:30:58,375 --> 00:30:59,933
Exactly how do we do that?

363
00:31:00,135 --> 00:31:03,844
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.

364
00:31:12,855 --> 00:31:16,484
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay. Okay.

365
00:31:20,015 --> 00:31:23,087
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

366
00:31:23,295 --> 00:31:25,650
Witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.

367
00:31:25,855 --> 00:31:29,370
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.

368
00:31:30,295 --> 00:31:31,569
Shut up, Malfoy.

369
00:31:45,495 --> 00:31:47,451
Dementor! Dementor!

370
00:31:55,135 --> 00:31:58,093
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.

371
00:31:58,255 --> 00:31:59,654
Yeah.

372
00:32:09,455 --> 00:32:12,333
Isn't he beautiful?

373
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:15,009
Say hello to Buckbeak.

374
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:17,725
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

375
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:19,891
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

376
00:32:20,055 --> 00:32:23,411
First thing you wanna know
is they're very proud creatures.

377
00:32:23,615 --> 00:32:27,324
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

378
00:32:27,495 --> 00:32:30,134
It may be the last thing you ever do.

379
00:32:30,295 --> 00:32:33,526
Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?

380
00:32:35,975 --> 00:32:37,966
Well done, Harry. Well done.

381
00:32:40,655 --> 00:32:41,974
Come on now.

382
00:32:42,495 --> 00:32:43,769
Now...

383
00:32:43,975 --> 00:32:47,524
...you have to let him make the first
move. It's only polite. So...

384
00:32:47,695 --> 00:32:49,492
...step up. Give him a nice bow.

385
00:32:49,695 --> 00:32:52,004
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.

386
00:32:52,175 --> 00:32:54,211
If he does, you can go and touch him.

387
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:57,447
If not... Well,
we'll get to that later.

388
00:33:00,015 --> 00:33:01,971
Just make your bow.

389
00:33:03,495 --> 00:33:05,087
Nice and low.

390
00:33:10,215 --> 00:33:11,807
Back off, Harry. Back off.

391
00:33:13,615 --> 00:33:15,048
Keep still.

392
00:33:16,655 --> 00:33:18,566
Keep still.

393
00:33:26,415 --> 00:33:30,647
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.

394
00:33:33,055 --> 00:33:35,489
Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.

395
00:33:35,695 --> 00:33:37,447
Go on. Don't be shy.

396
00:33:45,535 --> 00:33:47,890
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.

397
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,448
Not so fast, Harry.

398
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:00,452
Slow down, Harry. That's it...

399
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:03,692
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.

400
00:34:05,495 --> 00:34:07,725
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...

401
00:34:07,935 --> 00:34:09,653
That's it...

402
00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:11,529
Yes!

403
00:34:12,095 --> 00:34:15,371
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!

404
00:34:15,535 --> 00:34:17,446
Does he get to fly?

405
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,930
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?

406
00:34:20,135 --> 00:34:21,614
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!

407
00:34:21,775 --> 00:34:24,812
Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.

408
00:34:25,455 --> 00:34:29,653
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.

409
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:09,811
Well done, Harry, and well done,
Buckbeak.

410
00:36:10,015 --> 00:36:11,846
That was wicked, Harry!

411
00:36:12,055 --> 00:36:13,374
Oh, please.

412
00:36:14,135 --> 00:36:16,365
Well done, well done.

413
00:36:17,015 --> 00:36:20,087
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.

414
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:27,414
You're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!

415
00:36:27,615 --> 00:36:28,934
Malfoy, no...

416
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:31,214
No!

417
00:36:31,895 --> 00:36:33,453
Buckbeak!

418
00:36:33,655 --> 00:36:35,691
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

419
00:36:36,815 --> 00:36:38,533
Whoa! Buckbeak!

420
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:41,845
Away, you silly creature...

421
00:36:42,055 --> 00:36:45,013
- It's killed me!
- Calm down. It's just a scratch!

422
00:36:45,215 --> 00:36:46,364
Hagrid!

423
00:36:46,535 --> 00:36:51,529
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher. I'll do it.

424
00:36:54,455 --> 00:36:57,208
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!

425
00:36:57,375 --> 00:36:59,570
You and your bloody chicken!

426
00:37:22,095 --> 00:37:24,051
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

427
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:27,930
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.

428
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:31,292
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and I could've lost my arm.

429
00:37:31,615 --> 00:37:34,368
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.

430
00:37:34,615 --> 00:37:38,688
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

431
00:37:38,895 --> 00:37:42,444
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.

432
00:37:42,655 --> 00:37:44,407
- He's been sighted!
- Who?

433
00:37:44,615 --> 00:37:46,253
Sirius Black!

434
00:37:47,255 --> 00:37:50,133
Dufftown? That's not far from here.

435
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:53,049
You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts, do you?

436
00:37:53,215 --> 00:37:55,604
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?

437
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:58,972
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

438
00:37:59,175 --> 00:38:03,532
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.

439
00:38:04,295 --> 00:38:07,332
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

440
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:34,366
Intriguing, isn't it?

441
00:38:37,495 --> 00:38:40,134
Would anyone like to venture
a guess...

442
00:38:40,295 --> 00:38:42,013
...as to what is inside?

443
00:38:42,215 --> 00:38:46,049
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.

444
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:49,573
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?

445
00:38:49,775 --> 00:38:51,731
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?

446
00:38:51,935 --> 00:38:53,368
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

447
00:38:53,575 --> 00:38:56,647
They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.

448
00:38:56,855 --> 00:39:01,087
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...

449
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:06,528
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.

450
00:39:07,855 --> 00:39:11,450
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.

451
00:39:11,735 --> 00:39:14,124
After me. <i>Riddikulus!</i>

452
00:39:14,335 --> 00:39:16,371
<i>- Riddikulus!</i>
- Very good.

453
00:39:16,575 --> 00:39:18,964
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:

454
00:39:19,175 --> 00:39:21,291
<i>- Riddikulus!</i>
<i>- Riddikulus!</i>

455
00:39:21,495 --> 00:39:23,486
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.

456
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:27,529
So much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.

457
00:39:27,735 --> 00:39:31,284
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.

458
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:35,727
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.

459
00:39:35,895 --> 00:39:39,854
Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?

460
00:39:40,055 --> 00:39:42,285
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

461
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,847
Come on.

462
00:39:45,295 --> 00:39:48,651
Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?

463
00:39:48,855 --> 00:39:50,447
Professor Snape.

464
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:52,407
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.

465
00:39:52,575 --> 00:39:55,851
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

466
00:39:56,015 --> 00:40:00,327
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.

467
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,328
No...

468
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:05,808
...it won't. I want you
to picture her clothes.

469
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:09,127
Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.

470
00:40:09,335 --> 00:40:12,293
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.

471
00:40:12,455 --> 00:40:16,164
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe...

472
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,526
...here's what I want
you to do. Excuse me.

473
00:40:19,975 --> 00:40:22,773
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.

474
00:40:22,975 --> 00:40:24,613
Can you do that?

475
00:40:25,175 --> 00:40:27,769
Yes. Wand at the ready.

476
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:31,451
One, two, three.

477
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,652
Think, Neville, think.

478
00:40:45,295 --> 00:40:47,251
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

479
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,175
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...

480
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:57,173
...to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...

481
00:41:03,135 --> 00:41:04,409
Form a line!

482
00:41:04,575 --> 00:41:07,851
I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...

483
00:41:08,055 --> 00:41:11,013
...and turn it into something funny.

484
00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:12,853
Next! Ron!

485
00:41:15,935 --> 00:41:19,325
Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!

486
00:41:30,335 --> 00:41:31,814
Wand at the ready, Ron.

487
00:41:32,535 --> 00:41:34,287
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

488
00:41:34,455 --> 00:41:35,729
Yes!

489
00:41:36,335 --> 00:41:39,088
You see? Very good, very good!

490
00:41:39,575 --> 00:41:45,172
Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very
enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

491
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:49,011
Show us what you see.

492
00:41:57,895 --> 00:42:01,171
Keep your nerve. Steady.

493
00:42:01,335 --> 00:42:03,212
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

494
00:42:04,215 --> 00:42:06,092
And next! Step up, step up!

495
00:42:07,135 --> 00:42:08,887
Wonderful, wonderful!

496
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,371
Here!

497
00:42:29,975 --> 00:42:31,727
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

498
00:42:39,895 --> 00:42:42,693
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.

499
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:44,766
Collect your books from the back.

500
00:42:44,935 --> 00:42:47,449
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!

501
00:42:47,615 --> 00:42:50,527
Sorry, you can have too much
of a good thing.

502
00:42:52,455 --> 00:42:56,846
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.

503
00:42:57,135 --> 00:42:59,854
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school...

504
00:43:00,015 --> 00:43:02,813
...that privilege shall not
be extended again.

505
00:43:03,255 --> 00:43:06,406
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.

506
00:43:06,575 --> 00:43:08,054
That's the rule, Potter.

507
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:11,327
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.

508
00:43:11,495 --> 00:43:13,884
I thought if you signed it,
then I could...

509
00:43:14,055 --> 00:43:16,444
I can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.

510
00:43:16,615 --> 00:43:19,687
Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.

511
00:43:21,895 --> 00:43:26,286
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.

512
00:43:27,455 --> 00:43:30,572
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

513
00:43:43,815 --> 00:43:45,771
Professor, can I ask you something?

514
00:43:45,975 --> 00:43:49,650
You want to know why I stopped you
facing that boggart, yes?

515
00:43:49,855 --> 00:43:51,208
I thought it'd be obvious.

516
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:54,094
I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.

517
00:43:54,255 --> 00:43:57,611
I did think of Voldemort at first.

518
00:43:57,815 --> 00:44:00,329
But then I remembered that night
on the train...

519
00:44:00,495 --> 00:44:02,929
...and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.

520
00:44:03,095 --> 00:44:05,848
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.

521
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,448
This is very wise.

522
00:44:07,615 --> 00:44:09,606
Before I fainted...

523
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,766
...I heard something.

524
00:44:12,295 --> 00:44:13,853
A woman...

525
00:44:14,295 --> 00:44:15,569
...screaming.

526
00:44:15,775 --> 00:44:18,892
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.

527
00:44:19,095 --> 00:44:21,893
Our pain becomes their power.

528
00:44:22,695 --> 00:44:24,811
I think it was my mother...

529
00:44:24,975 --> 00:44:27,091
...the night she was murdered.

530
00:44:28,655 --> 00:44:32,933
The very first time I saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.

531
00:44:33,495 --> 00:44:36,214
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

532
00:44:36,615 --> 00:44:38,685
They're your mother, Lily's.

533
00:44:39,575 --> 00:44:40,974
Yes.

534
00:44:41,295 --> 00:44:44,173
Oh, yes. I knew her.

535
00:44:46,415 --> 00:44:50,090
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.

536
00:44:50,295 --> 00:44:53,367
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...

537
00:44:53,535 --> 00:44:56,732
...she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.

538
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:00,173
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...

539
00:45:00,335 --> 00:45:06,251
...even, and most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.

540
00:45:07,655 --> 00:45:10,249
And your father, James,
on the other hand...

541
00:45:10,415 --> 00:45:11,894
...he...

542
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:15,572
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.

543
00:45:17,775 --> 00:45:23,054
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.

544
00:45:26,895 --> 00:45:29,728
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.

545
00:45:30,535 --> 00:45:33,527
In time, you'll come to see
just how much.

546
00:45:36,855 --> 00:45:41,053
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

547
00:45:41,255 --> 00:45:43,689
We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.

548
00:45:43,855 --> 00:45:47,734
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain. I know.

549
00:45:49,055 --> 00:45:50,488
What's going on?

550
00:45:50,655 --> 00:45:53,010
Probably Neville forgot
the password again.

551
00:45:53,175 --> 00:45:55,484
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.

552
00:45:55,655 --> 00:45:59,773
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

553
00:46:01,335 --> 00:46:02,927
Get back, all of you.

554
00:46:03,095 --> 00:46:06,132
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been searched.

555
00:46:06,295 --> 00:46:07,569
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

556
00:46:09,575 --> 00:46:11,930
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.

557
00:46:12,095 --> 00:46:13,926
It's not funny, Ron.

558
00:46:15,855 --> 00:46:19,768
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.

559
00:46:25,855 --> 00:46:26,844
- Be quiet.
- Make way.

560
00:46:27,055 --> 00:46:28,932
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.

561
00:46:29,135 --> 00:46:30,932
You heard. Move!

562
00:46:44,575 --> 00:46:47,328
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

563
00:46:47,655 --> 00:46:51,568
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

564
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:54,733
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

565
00:46:55,535 --> 00:46:57,571
The Fat Lady's there.

566
00:46:58,375 --> 00:47:00,286
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

567
00:47:00,855 --> 00:47:03,415
You listen! I'm Head Boy!

568
00:47:03,575 --> 00:47:05,884
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!

569
00:47:09,335 --> 00:47:12,088
Dear lady, who did this to you?

570
00:47:13,935 --> 00:47:18,770
Eyes like the devil, he's got,
and a soul as dark as his name.

571
00:47:19,655 --> 00:47:22,533
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.

572
00:47:22,695 --> 00:47:25,050
He's here, somewhere in the castle!

573
00:47:25,295 --> 00:47:27,365
Sirius Black!

574
00:47:27,575 --> 00:47:32,490
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

575
00:47:59,415 --> 00:48:04,125
I've searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

576
00:48:04,295 --> 00:48:06,763
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.

577
00:48:06,935 --> 00:48:08,812
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.

578
00:48:08,975 --> 00:48:11,535
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the castle.

579
00:48:11,735 --> 00:48:14,124
I didn't really expect him to linger.

580
00:48:15,335 --> 00:48:17,565
Remarkable feat, don't you think?

581
00:48:17,735 --> 00:48:19,930
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own...

582
00:48:20,095 --> 00:48:22,655
...completely undetected?
- Quite remarkable, yes.

583
00:48:22,855 --> 00:48:24,607
Any theories on how he managed it?

584
00:48:24,815 --> 00:48:27,648
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

585
00:48:27,895 --> 00:48:29,374
You may recall...

586
00:48:29,535 --> 00:48:32,254
...prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...

587
00:48:32,415 --> 00:48:34,406
...about your appointment
of Professor...

588
00:48:34,575 --> 00:48:38,488
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.

589
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,964
I'm quite convinced
the castle is safe...

590
00:48:41,135 --> 00:48:44,605
...and I'm more than willing to send
the students to their houses.

591
00:48:44,775 --> 00:48:47,005
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?

592
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,729
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

593
00:48:50,575 --> 00:48:55,091
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.

594
00:48:55,375 --> 00:49:01,610
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.

595
00:49:37,415 --> 00:49:40,612
Turn to page 394.

596
00:49:49,655 --> 00:49:53,091
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?

597
00:49:53,775 --> 00:49:57,051
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?

598
00:49:57,215 --> 00:50:00,924
Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...

599
00:50:01,135 --> 00:50:05,970
...at the present time.
Turn to page 394.

600
00:50:10,615 --> 00:50:12,207
"Werewolves"?

601
00:50:12,535 --> 00:50:15,174
Sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.

602
00:50:15,415 --> 00:50:18,407
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.

603
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:21,652
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?

604
00:50:22,255 --> 00:50:25,611
Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...

605
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:28,124
...between an Animagus
and a werewolf?

606
00:50:28,815 --> 00:50:30,646
No one?

607
00:50:31,135 --> 00:50:33,933
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.

608
00:50:34,135 --> 00:50:37,172
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.

609
00:50:37,335 --> 00:50:38,814
A werewolf has no choice.

610
00:50:39,215 --> 00:50:40,853
With each full moon...

611
00:50:41,015 --> 00:50:44,724
...he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.

612
00:50:44,935 --> 00:50:48,371
The werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.

613
00:50:49,495 --> 00:50:52,134
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...

614
00:50:52,295 --> 00:50:54,525
...you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.

615
00:50:54,695 --> 00:50:56,606
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...

616
00:50:56,775 --> 00:50:59,972
...or do you take pride
in being an insufferable know-it-all?

617
00:51:00,255 --> 00:51:03,531
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.

618
00:51:03,735 --> 00:51:08,126
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...

619
00:51:08,335 --> 00:51:11,884
...two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with emphasis...

620
00:51:12,055 --> 00:51:14,523
...on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.

621
00:51:15,575 --> 00:51:18,772
Then I suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.

622
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:22,854
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

623
00:51:23,055 --> 00:51:26,650
Page 394.

624
00:51:28,575 --> 00:51:29,974
The term "werewolf"...

625
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:35,167
...is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word "<i>wer</i>"...

626
00:51:35,895 --> 00:51:40,127
...which means "man," and "wolf."
Werewolf, man-wolf.

627
00:51:40,775 --> 00:51:43,005
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.

628
00:51:43,215 --> 00:51:46,093
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...

629
00:51:46,335 --> 00:51:48,166
...being bitten by a werewolf...

630
00:52:06,215 --> 00:52:09,685
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

631
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:07,294
<i>Aresto momentum!</i>

632
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:12,447
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?

633
00:54:12,615 --> 00:54:14,810
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.

634
00:54:14,975 --> 00:54:17,728
Let's walk you off a tower
and see what you look like.

635
00:54:17,935 --> 00:54:20,847
Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.

636
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:27,208
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.

637
00:54:27,415 --> 00:54:29,292
You gave us a right good scare.

638
00:54:29,535 --> 00:54:32,891
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.

639
00:54:33,175 --> 00:54:35,405
Really? I meant the match. Who won?

640
00:54:39,655 --> 00:54:41,293
No one blames you, Harry.

641
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:45,170
Dementors aren't supposed to be
on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.

642
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:47,366
After he saved you,
he sent them off.

643
00:54:47,535 --> 00:54:51,050
There's something else
you should know too.

644
00:54:51,575 --> 00:54:57,650
When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and...

645
00:54:58,135 --> 00:54:59,568
Well...

646
00:55:00,775 --> 00:55:02,970
<i>I'm sorry to hear</i>
<i>about your broomstick.</i>

647
00:55:03,295 --> 00:55:05,809
Is there no chance of fixing it?

648
00:55:05,975 --> 00:55:07,294
No.

649
00:55:07,455 --> 00:55:10,652
Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?

650
00:55:11,055 --> 00:55:14,013
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.

651
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:17,212
Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.

652
00:55:17,415 --> 00:55:21,488
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...

653
00:55:22,015 --> 00:55:26,406
...until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.

654
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:30,654
You are not weak, Harry.

655
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:34,728
Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.

656
00:55:34,935 --> 00:55:37,893
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.

657
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,530
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

658
00:55:40,735 --> 00:55:44,614
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

659
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:48,131
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

660
00:55:48,295 --> 00:55:50,206
You made the one
on the train go away.

661
00:55:50,415 --> 00:55:52,087
There was only one that night.

662
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:56,766
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

663
00:55:57,095 --> 00:56:01,850
But as the dementors seem
to have developed an interest in you...

664
00:56:02,015 --> 00:56:05,530
...perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.

665
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,526
For now, I need to rest.

666
00:56:31,935 --> 00:56:36,053
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!

667
00:56:51,015 --> 00:56:52,926
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.

668
00:56:53,095 --> 00:56:55,893
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.

669
00:56:56,055 --> 00:56:58,774
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.

670
00:56:58,935 --> 00:57:00,084
We'll get you there.

671
00:57:00,255 --> 00:57:02,849
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- Lf you pipe down.

672
00:57:03,015 --> 00:57:06,451
- Bless him.
- Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...

673
00:57:07,055 --> 00:57:09,523
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.

674
00:57:10,895 --> 00:57:12,931
What are you doing?!

675
00:57:13,175 --> 00:57:15,894
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.

676
00:57:16,055 --> 00:57:19,252
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...

677
00:57:19,415 --> 00:57:22,213
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.

678
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:24,047
George, if you will.

679
00:57:24,215 --> 00:57:27,366
I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.

680
00:57:30,855 --> 00:57:34,291
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail,
Padfoot and Prongs...

681
00:57:34,695 --> 00:57:37,528
...are proud to present
the Marauder's Map."

682
00:57:37,775 --> 00:57:39,925
We owe them so much.

683
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:47,010
Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that...

684
00:57:47,175 --> 00:57:49,530
- No. Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.

685
00:57:49,695 --> 00:57:50,969
- In his study.
- Pacing.

686
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:53,012
Does that a lot.

687
00:57:53,215 --> 00:57:54,967
- So this map shows...
- Everyone.

688
00:57:55,175 --> 00:57:57,086
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.

689
00:57:57,255 --> 00:57:58,324
- Every minute.
- Every day.

690
00:57:58,495 --> 00:58:01,373
- Brilliant! Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.

691
00:58:01,535 --> 00:58:04,174
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways...

692
00:58:04,335 --> 00:58:06,895
...out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.

693
00:58:07,055 --> 00:58:10,092
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.

694
00:58:10,255 --> 00:58:12,007
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

695
00:58:12,175 --> 00:58:15,451
And don't forget. When you're done,
just give it a tap and say:

696
00:58:15,615 --> 00:58:19,767
"Mischief managed."
Otherwise, anyone can read it.

697
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,771
Now, how much do you want?

698
00:59:02,775 --> 00:59:04,606
Delicious.

699
00:59:12,295 --> 00:59:16,208
It's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did I mention that?

700
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:17,967
Twice.

701
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:20,885
Do you want to move a bit closer?

702
00:59:21,095 --> 00:59:22,733
To the Shrieking Shack?

703
00:59:23,015 --> 00:59:25,768
Actually, I'm fine here.

704
00:59:25,935 --> 00:59:27,687
Well, well. Look who's here.

705
00:59:28,055 --> 00:59:30,250
You two shopping for your new
dream home?

706
00:59:30,455 --> 00:59:34,573
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?

707
00:59:34,775 --> 00:59:37,847
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.

708
00:59:38,135 --> 00:59:43,050
Boys, I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

709
00:59:43,255 --> 00:59:46,531
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!

710
00:59:46,695 --> 00:59:48,606
You filthy little mudblood!

711
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:54,134
Who is that?

712
01:00:00,095 --> 01:00:02,370
- Don't stand there! Do something!
- What?

713
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,570
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

714
01:00:27,375 --> 01:00:28,728
Get out of the way!

715
01:00:28,895 --> 01:00:30,453
Move!

716
01:00:30,895 --> 01:00:33,773
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

717
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:39,252
Harry!

718
01:00:39,415 --> 01:00:43,294
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.

719
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:47,532
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.

720
01:00:47,735 --> 01:00:51,011
He won't keep it. He'll turn it over
to Professor McGonagall.

721
01:00:51,255 --> 01:00:55,043
- Aren't you?
- Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.

722
01:00:55,215 --> 01:00:57,604
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

723
01:00:57,815 --> 01:01:00,010
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!

724
01:01:00,175 --> 01:01:01,972
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!

725
01:01:02,135 --> 01:01:03,454
Allow me, minister.

726
01:01:03,655 --> 01:01:05,407
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.

727
01:01:05,615 --> 01:01:08,413
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.

728
01:01:08,615 --> 01:01:12,324
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...

729
01:01:12,495 --> 01:01:16,374
...into my pub every other night!
- We have...

730
01:01:16,775 --> 01:01:19,847
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

731
01:01:20,175 --> 01:01:22,530
And what would bring him here?

732
01:01:22,695 --> 01:01:26,688
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?

733
01:01:26,855 --> 01:01:28,527
Come.

734
01:01:30,975 --> 01:01:32,886
Harry!

735
01:01:40,295 --> 01:01:44,573
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!

736
01:01:44,775 --> 01:01:46,686
- So rude.
- Thick heads.

737
01:01:46,935 --> 01:01:48,448
- Thick heads?!
- How dare they!

738
01:01:48,655 --> 01:01:51,692
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!

739
01:01:52,415 --> 01:01:56,169
Nobody will come to a pub where
they'll get scared out of their wits.

740
01:01:56,335 --> 01:02:00,089
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want
dementors around the place.

741
01:02:02,775 --> 01:02:04,493
Tell me what this is all about.

742
01:02:04,655 --> 01:02:08,933
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death...

743
01:02:09,095 --> 01:02:11,655
Remember? They hid.
Few knew where they were.

744
01:02:11,855 --> 01:02:15,530
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.

745
01:02:15,735 --> 01:02:18,807
Not only did Black lead him
to the Potters that night...

746
01:02:18,975 --> 01:02:22,206
...he also killed Peter Pettigrew!

747
01:02:22,455 --> 01:02:24,525
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

748
01:02:24,695 --> 01:02:26,845
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.

749
01:02:27,015 --> 01:02:28,767
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.

750
01:02:28,935 --> 01:02:31,574
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters...

751
01:02:31,735 --> 01:02:35,728
...and might have, had he not
run into an old friend, Sirius Black.

752
01:02:35,935 --> 01:02:39,610
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.

753
01:02:39,815 --> 01:02:41,885
He destroyed him!

754
01:02:42,495 --> 01:02:47,046
A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.

755
01:02:47,215 --> 01:02:50,127
Sirius Black may not have
put his hands to the Potters...

756
01:02:50,295 --> 01:02:53,367
...but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.

757
01:02:53,575 --> 01:02:56,294
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.

758
01:02:56,495 --> 01:03:00,090
- What could be worse?
- This: Sirius Black was...

759
01:03:00,295 --> 01:03:02,331
...and remains to this day...

760
01:03:02,775 --> 01:03:04,333
...Harry Potter's godfather!

761
01:03:12,615 --> 01:03:14,810
Ron, look!

762
01:03:20,295 --> 01:03:22,763
- Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.

763
01:03:59,655 --> 01:04:01,407
Harry, what happened?

764
01:04:03,815 --> 01:04:05,851
He was their friend...

765
01:04:06,335 --> 01:04:08,485
...and he betrayed them.

766
01:04:09,255 --> 01:04:11,132
He was their friend!

767
01:04:13,295 --> 01:04:15,172
I hope he finds me.

768
01:04:15,775 --> 01:04:18,005
Because when he does,
I'm gonna be ready!

769
01:04:18,455 --> 01:04:20,969
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

770
01:04:34,655 --> 01:04:36,213
<i>Harry.</i>

771
01:04:36,695 --> 01:04:38,287
<i>There you are. You came.</i>

772
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:42,364
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic...

773
01:04:42,535 --> 01:04:44,890
...well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.

774
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,534
I'm sure.

775
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:49,450
Well, everything's prepared.

776
01:04:49,695 --> 01:04:52,926
The spell I'm going to teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.

777
01:04:53,135 --> 01:04:54,534
Did you ever hear of it?

778
01:04:54,695 --> 01:04:56,287
No? Well...

779
01:04:56,455 --> 01:04:59,891
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...

780
01:05:00,055 --> 01:05:04,526
...it works like a shield, with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.

781
01:05:04,695 --> 01:05:08,370
But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.

782
01:05:08,535 --> 01:05:12,323
Not just any memory, a very happy
memory, a very powerful memory.

783
01:05:12,535 --> 01:05:16,164
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.

784
01:05:17,335 --> 01:05:19,451
Close your eyes.

785
01:05:21,175 --> 01:05:22,972
Concentrate.

786
01:05:24,175 --> 01:05:26,166
Explore your past.

787
01:05:26,655 --> 01:05:28,452
Do you have a memory?

788
01:05:29,975 --> 01:05:32,091
Allow it to fill you up.

789
01:05:32,775 --> 01:05:34,766
Lose yourself within it.

790
01:05:35,095 --> 01:05:40,215
Then speak the incantation,
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

791
01:05:40,615 --> 01:05:43,334
<i>- Expecto Patronum.</i>
- Very good.

792
01:05:46,975 --> 01:05:50,172
Shall we? Wand at the ready.

793
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:09,773
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

794
01:06:10,215 --> 01:06:13,730
<i>Expecto... Expecto...</i>

795
01:06:13,975 --> 01:06:15,613
<i>Expect...</i>

796
01:06:17,535 --> 01:06:21,448
Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.

797
01:06:21,735 --> 01:06:25,364
It's all right. I didn't expect you
to do it the first time.

798
01:06:25,775 --> 01:06:30,690
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.

799
01:06:31,495 --> 01:06:34,248
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.

800
01:06:34,455 --> 01:06:37,094
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.

801
01:06:37,255 --> 01:06:40,292
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.

802
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:42,969
As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?

803
01:06:43,135 --> 01:06:46,684
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.

804
01:06:47,855 --> 01:06:51,052
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.

805
01:06:57,655 --> 01:07:02,683
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.

806
01:07:04,535 --> 01:07:06,571
Well, it is.

807
01:07:06,735 --> 01:07:09,203
It's the happiest I've ever felt...

808
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:13,163
...but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?

809
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:20,094
Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?

810
01:07:21,815 --> 01:07:23,487
Just do it.

811
01:07:33,135 --> 01:07:36,252
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

812
01:07:37,455 --> 01:07:41,243
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

813
01:08:01,975 --> 01:08:03,010
Yes!

814
01:08:04,895 --> 01:08:08,171
Well done, Harry. Well done!

815
01:08:08,695 --> 01:08:12,654
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes. Sit down. Here.

816
01:08:12,815 --> 01:08:15,124
Eat this, it helps. It really helps.

817
01:08:15,295 --> 01:08:17,013
And just so you know, Harry...

818
01:08:17,175 --> 01:08:21,009
...I think you'd have given your father
a run for his money. And that...

819
01:08:21,175 --> 01:08:23,131
...is saying something.

820
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:27,126
I was thinking of him.

821
01:08:27,295 --> 01:08:29,365
And Mum.

822
01:08:29,535 --> 01:08:31,685
Seeing their faces.

823
01:08:32,295 --> 01:08:34,889
They were talking to me.

824
01:08:35,055 --> 01:08:37,205
Just talking.

825
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:39,605
That's the memory I chose.

826
01:08:41,175 --> 01:08:43,530
I don't even know if it's real.

827
01:08:44,015 --> 01:08:46,085
But it's the best I have.

828
01:08:54,935 --> 01:08:57,165
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.

829
01:08:57,335 --> 01:08:59,246
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!

830
01:08:59,415 --> 01:09:01,724
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?

831
01:09:01,895 --> 01:09:04,932
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!

832
01:09:05,095 --> 01:09:07,131
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.

833
01:09:07,295 --> 01:09:10,492
Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...

834
01:09:10,655 --> 01:09:14,409
...is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.

835
01:09:14,575 --> 01:09:17,328
Well, maybe you should
take better care of your pets!

836
01:09:17,495 --> 01:09:19,486
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.

837
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,088
- Did.
- Didn't.

838
01:09:23,055 --> 01:09:25,569
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

839
01:09:25,735 --> 01:09:28,886
Well, first off, the committee members
took turns...

840
01:09:29,055 --> 01:09:31,615
...talking about why we were there.

841
01:09:33,415 --> 01:09:35,975
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...

842
01:09:36,135 --> 01:09:38,968
...was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.

843
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,087
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.

844
01:09:42,255 --> 01:09:45,327
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature...

845
01:09:45,495 --> 01:09:48,407
...who would kill you
as soon as look at you.

846
01:09:48,615 --> 01:09:50,333
And then?

847
01:09:51,015 --> 01:09:53,609
And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.

848
01:09:53,775 --> 01:09:57,734
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.

849
01:09:59,735 --> 01:10:02,613
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

850
01:10:28,295 --> 01:10:33,688
Spiders! There's... There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

851
01:10:33,895 --> 01:10:36,329
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.

852
01:10:36,535 --> 01:10:40,323
Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...

853
01:10:57,735 --> 01:10:59,805
<i>- Peter Pettigrew?</i>
<i>- Little lump of a boy.</i>

854
01:10:59,975 --> 01:11:02,967
<i>- Always trailing after Sirius Black.</i>
<i>- Black was vicious.</i>

855
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:05,530
<i>He didn 't kill Pettigrew,</i>
<i>he destroyed him!</i>

856
01:11:13,295 --> 01:11:16,605
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.

857
01:11:58,095 --> 01:12:02,054
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!

858
01:12:09,935 --> 01:12:12,403
Mischief managed. <i>Nox.</i>

859
01:12:14,535 --> 01:12:15,809
Potter.

860
01:12:15,975 --> 01:12:19,331
What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?

861
01:12:19,495 --> 01:12:20,610
I was sleepwalking.

862
01:12:20,775 --> 01:12:23,209
How extraordinarily like your father
you are, Potter.

863
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:27,926
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the castle.

864
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:32,287
My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.

865
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:35,973
If you don't mind, I would appreciate
it if you could lower your wand.

866
01:12:39,425 --> 01:12:41,177
Turn out your pockets.

867
01:12:42,785 --> 01:12:45,299
Turn out your pockets!

868
01:12:48,105 --> 01:12:49,663
What's this?

869
01:12:49,825 --> 01:12:52,942
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really? Open it.

870
01:12:59,185 --> 01:13:02,780
Reveal your secrets.

871
01:13:06,425 --> 01:13:07,824
Read it.

872
01:13:10,185 --> 01:13:15,464
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs...

873
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:19,584
...offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and..."

874
01:13:19,865 --> 01:13:21,298
Go on.

875
01:13:22,425 --> 01:13:26,134
"And request he keep his large nose
out of other people's business."

876
01:13:26,345 --> 01:13:28,779
- You insolent little...
- Professor!

877
01:13:30,345 --> 01:13:32,939
Well, well. Lupin.

878
01:13:33,105 --> 01:13:37,621
Out for a little walk
in the moonlight, are we?

879
01:13:38,945 --> 01:13:41,254
Harry, are you all right?

880
01:13:41,465 --> 01:13:43,820
That remains to be seen.

881
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:48,220
I have now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact.

882
01:13:48,385 --> 01:13:51,775
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.

883
01:13:51,945 --> 01:13:56,541
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.

884
01:13:56,705 --> 01:14:00,061
It looks as though it's a parchment
designed to insult anyone...

885
01:14:00,225 --> 01:14:03,934
...who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.

886
01:14:04,105 --> 01:14:08,178
Nevertheless, I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.

887
01:14:08,345 --> 01:14:11,337
It is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.

888
01:14:11,505 --> 01:14:14,702
Harry, would you come with me,
please? Professor, good night.

889
01:14:20,465 --> 01:14:23,104
Are you deaf? Put that light out!

890
01:14:27,985 --> 01:14:29,384
Come in.

891
01:14:31,105 --> 01:14:36,099
I haven't the faintest idea how this map
came to be in your possession...

892
01:14:36,265 --> 01:14:40,577
...but quite frankly, I am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.

893
01:14:40,745 --> 01:14:44,260
Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black...

894
01:14:44,425 --> 01:14:46,336
...is a map to you?

895
01:14:47,145 --> 01:14:49,500
- No.
- No, sir.

896
01:14:51,425 --> 01:14:54,337
Your father never set much store
by the rules either.

897
01:14:54,505 --> 01:14:58,657
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.

898
01:14:59,265 --> 01:15:03,178
Gambling their sacrifice
by wandering the castle unprotected...

899
01:15:03,345 --> 01:15:07,623
...with a killer on the loose
seems to me a poor way to repay them!

900
01:15:07,825 --> 01:15:09,895
Now, I will not cover up for you again.

901
01:15:10,065 --> 01:15:12,420
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

902
01:15:12,585 --> 01:15:16,100
I want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.

903
01:15:16,265 --> 01:15:20,816
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.

904
01:15:25,305 --> 01:15:29,537
Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.

905
01:15:30,385 --> 01:15:35,140
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.

906
01:15:35,545 --> 01:15:38,184
Oh, really? And who might that be?

907
01:15:38,345 --> 01:15:39,824
Peter Pettigrew.

908
01:15:42,345 --> 01:15:44,336
That's not possible.

909
01:15:45,505 --> 01:15:47,097
It's just what I saw.

910
01:15:49,825 --> 01:15:51,463
Good night, professor.

911
01:15:54,825 --> 01:15:58,818
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.

912
01:15:58,985 --> 01:16:04,184
The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.

913
01:16:04,345 --> 01:16:07,542
Only then can you see. Try again.

914
01:16:08,065 --> 01:16:10,056
Now, what do we have here?

915
01:16:12,305 --> 01:16:14,421
Do you mind me trying?

916
01:16:16,745 --> 01:16:19,578
The Grim, possibly.

917
01:16:21,665 --> 01:16:25,578
My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...

918
01:16:25,745 --> 01:16:29,374
...I sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...

919
01:16:29,545 --> 01:16:33,299
...for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.

920
01:16:33,465 --> 01:16:36,980
You may be young in years,
but your heart is as shriveled...

921
01:16:37,145 --> 01:16:40,979
...as an old maid's, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...

922
01:16:41,145 --> 01:16:44,137
...to which you so desperately cleave.

923
01:16:59,025 --> 01:17:00,936
Have I said something?

924
01:17:05,425 --> 01:17:10,215
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental...

925
01:17:10,385 --> 01:17:12,853
...but now it's in the open
for everyone to see.

926
01:17:13,025 --> 01:17:15,095
Hang on.

927
01:17:15,305 --> 01:17:18,058
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.

928
01:17:18,385 --> 01:17:21,661
- Fine. See you later.
- See you.

929
01:17:57,865 --> 01:18:02,939
<i>Harry Potter...</i>

930
01:18:09,545 --> 01:18:13,618
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.

931
01:18:13,785 --> 01:18:15,343
Sorry?

932
01:18:15,545 --> 01:18:19,982
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...

933
01:18:20,145 --> 01:18:22,101
...shall break free.

934
01:18:22,265 --> 01:18:24,415
Innocent blood shall be spilt...

935
01:18:24,585 --> 01:18:30,342
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

936
01:18:36,425 --> 01:18:39,542
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?

937
01:18:40,305 --> 01:18:42,023
No.

938
01:18:42,465 --> 01:18:43,944
Nothing.

939
01:19:34,385 --> 01:19:38,264
I can't believe they're going to kill
Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.

940
01:19:38,425 --> 01:19:41,064
- It just got worse.
- What did I say? Father said...

941
01:19:41,225 --> 01:19:45,218
...I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.

942
01:19:45,385 --> 01:19:47,740
This is going to be rich.

943
01:19:47,945 --> 01:19:50,015
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?

944
01:19:50,185 --> 01:19:53,177
You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

945
01:19:53,345 --> 01:19:55,017
Hermione, no!

946
01:19:55,585 --> 01:19:57,735
He's not worth it.

947
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:13,221
Malfoy, are you okay?

948
01:20:13,425 --> 01:20:17,464
- Let's go. Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

949
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:21,857
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

950
01:20:40,505 --> 01:20:44,623
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.

951
01:20:44,785 --> 01:20:46,980
Why don't we just set him free?

952
01:20:47,145 --> 01:20:49,454
They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore...

953
01:20:49,625 --> 01:20:52,503
...would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.

954
01:20:52,665 --> 01:20:54,940
Says he wants to be with me
when they...

955
01:20:55,905 --> 01:20:57,861
When it happens.

956
01:20:58,025 --> 01:20:59,299
Great man, Dumbledore.

957
01:21:00,265 --> 01:21:01,744
A great man.

958
01:21:04,105 --> 01:21:06,983
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!

959
01:21:07,145 --> 01:21:10,182
Think I want you seeing
something like that? No.

960
01:21:10,345 --> 01:21:13,860
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron...

961
01:21:20,985 --> 01:21:23,260
Scabbers! You're alive!

962
01:21:23,425 --> 01:21:26,974
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.

963
01:21:27,145 --> 01:21:30,740
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let him know.

964
01:21:30,905 --> 01:21:31,940
I meant me!

965
01:21:32,625 --> 01:21:34,741
Blimey. What was that?

966
01:21:40,945 --> 01:21:42,298
Hagrid!

967
01:21:44,145 --> 01:21:45,419
Oh, crikey.

968
01:21:46,825 --> 01:21:49,464
No, minister. Over this way.

969
01:21:49,665 --> 01:21:53,578
It's late. It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.

970
01:21:53,745 --> 01:21:57,374
Someone sees you outside
this time of night, you'll be in trouble.

971
01:21:57,545 --> 01:22:00,981
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!

972
01:22:02,345 --> 01:22:04,654
Quick. Quick!

973
01:22:04,825 --> 01:22:06,497
Hagrid.

974
01:22:06,665 --> 01:22:10,419
- It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!

975
01:22:12,185 --> 01:22:14,858
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.

976
01:22:15,025 --> 01:22:17,585
- On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.

977
01:22:17,745 --> 01:22:20,339
- Good evening.
- Minister. Make your way through.

978
01:22:20,545 --> 01:22:24,220
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.

979
01:22:26,225 --> 01:22:28,693
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.

980
01:22:28,905 --> 01:22:32,102
Well, I think we should get down
to our business, shall we?

981
01:22:33,225 --> 01:22:36,661
Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...

982
01:22:36,825 --> 01:22:39,862
...of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff Buckbeak...

983
01:22:40,025 --> 01:22:45,304
...hereinafter called "the condemned,"
shall be executed this day at sundown.

984
01:22:45,465 --> 01:22:48,855
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.

985
01:22:49,065 --> 01:22:53,263
- All right. It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...

986
01:22:53,425 --> 01:22:55,097
What?

987
01:22:55,265 --> 01:22:57,256
I thought I just saw...

988
01:22:57,425 --> 01:22:59,461
- Never mind.
- Let's go!

989
01:23:04,345 --> 01:23:06,575
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

990
01:23:51,185 --> 01:23:52,584
Oh, no.

991
01:24:03,065 --> 01:24:05,181
He bit me. Scabbers.

992
01:24:05,745 --> 01:24:07,622
Ron. Ron!

993
01:24:08,545 --> 01:24:11,935
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.

994
01:24:13,385 --> 01:24:15,057
Wait!

995
01:24:20,745 --> 01:24:24,863
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?

996
01:24:25,025 --> 01:24:27,220
That's not good. Ron, run!

997
01:24:30,225 --> 01:24:32,659
Harry, Hermione, run!

998
01:24:33,225 --> 01:24:34,783
It's the Grim!

999
01:24:41,505 --> 01:24:44,417
- Harry!
- Ron! Ron, wait!

1000
01:24:44,625 --> 01:24:46,536
Harry!

1001
01:24:48,065 --> 01:24:50,340
- Help!
- Ron!

1002
01:24:52,385 --> 01:24:55,502
- Ron. Ron.
- Ron!

1003
01:25:09,745 --> 01:25:11,656
Come on!

1004
01:25:13,505 --> 01:25:14,858
Move!

1005
01:25:18,745 --> 01:25:20,417
Duck!

1006
01:25:54,825 --> 01:25:57,020
Harry!

1007
01:26:12,265 --> 01:26:15,143
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

1008
01:26:15,305 --> 01:26:19,059
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.

1009
01:26:19,585 --> 01:26:21,018
I just hope I'm wrong.

1010
01:26:39,905 --> 01:26:42,942
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?

1011
01:26:43,985 --> 01:26:45,543
Come on.

1012
01:26:55,465 --> 01:26:56,818
Ron.

1013
01:26:57,345 --> 01:26:59,859
- Ron. You're okay.
- The dog. Where is it?

1014
01:27:00,065 --> 01:27:03,137
It's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.

1015
01:27:16,465 --> 01:27:19,138
If you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill us too!

1016
01:27:19,305 --> 01:27:21,023
No. Only one will die tonight.

1017
01:27:21,225 --> 01:27:23,056
Then it'll be you!

1018
01:27:29,025 --> 01:27:31,095
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

1019
01:27:32,265 --> 01:27:34,017
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1020
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:41,578
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

1021
01:27:41,785 --> 01:27:44,697
Finally, the flesh
reflects the madness within.

1022
01:27:45,265 --> 01:27:48,735
Well, you'd know all about
the madness within, wouldn't you?

1023
01:27:58,745 --> 01:27:59,734
- I found him.
- I know.

1024
01:27:59,905 --> 01:28:01,133
- It's him.
- I understand.

1025
01:28:01,305 --> 01:28:04,377
- Let's kill him!
- No! I trusted you!

1026
01:28:04,785 --> 01:28:08,380
And all this time,
you've been his friend.

1027
01:28:09,065 --> 01:28:11,977
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.

1028
01:28:14,665 --> 01:28:16,303
How long have you known?

1029
01:28:16,785 --> 01:28:19,857
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.

1030
01:28:20,065 --> 01:28:22,863
You are the brightest witch
of your age I've ever met.

1031
01:28:23,025 --> 01:28:25,334
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!

1032
01:28:25,545 --> 01:28:28,059
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!

1033
01:28:28,225 --> 01:28:30,534
Twelve years of it!

1034
01:28:31,145 --> 01:28:33,420
In Azkaban!

1035
01:28:42,505 --> 01:28:44,177
Very well. Kill him.

1036
01:28:44,745 --> 01:28:48,340
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.

1037
01:28:48,505 --> 01:28:50,018
I know why.

1038
01:28:50,225 --> 01:28:52,375
You betrayed my parents.

1039
01:28:52,545 --> 01:28:55,343
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.

1040
01:28:55,505 --> 01:28:57,336
Somebody did betray your parents...

1041
01:28:57,505 --> 01:29:00,861
...somebody who, until quite recently,
I believed to be dead!

1042
01:29:01,065 --> 01:29:04,375
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!

1043
01:29:04,545 --> 01:29:07,537
And he's in this room! Right now!

1044
01:29:08,025 --> 01:29:10,858
Come out, come out, Peter!

1045
01:29:11,025 --> 01:29:13,903
- Come out, come out and play!
<i>- Expelliarmus!</i>

1046
01:29:16,745 --> 01:29:19,134
Vengeance is sweet.

1047
01:29:19,305 --> 01:29:21,455
How I hoped I'd be the one
to catch you.

1048
01:29:21,625 --> 01:29:22,899
Severus...

1049
01:29:23,065 --> 01:29:27,616
I told Dumbledore you were helping a
friend into the castle. Here's the proof.

1050
01:29:27,785 --> 01:29:29,059
Brilliant, Snape.

1051
01:29:29,225 --> 01:29:33,423
You've put your keen mind to the task
and come to the wrong conclusion.

1052
01:29:33,625 --> 01:29:36,185
If you'll excuse us,
Remus and I have business...

1053
01:29:36,345 --> 01:29:41,135
...to attend to.
- Give me a reason. I beg you!

1054
01:29:41,305 --> 01:29:43,773
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it. It's habit.

1055
01:29:43,985 --> 01:29:45,498
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!

1056
01:29:45,665 --> 01:29:47,974
You two, quarrelling
like an old married couple.

1057
01:29:48,145 --> 01:29:50,579
Run along and play with
your chemistry set!

1058
01:29:51,105 --> 01:29:53,494
I could do it, you know.

1059
01:29:53,945 --> 01:29:59,338
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.

1060
01:29:59,505 --> 01:30:02,099
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.

1061
01:30:02,265 --> 01:30:05,621
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like.

1062
01:30:05,785 --> 01:30:10,984
It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness, but I'll do my best.

1063
01:30:11,185 --> 01:30:13,335
Severus, please.

1064
01:30:14,345 --> 01:30:16,256
After you.

1065
01:30:20,505 --> 01:30:22,177
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1066
01:30:23,865 --> 01:30:27,301
- Harry! What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!

1067
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:29,973
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.

1068
01:30:30,145 --> 01:30:31,737
We thought he was our friend!

1069
01:30:31,905 --> 01:30:34,783
- No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
- No, he didn't.

1070
01:30:34,945 --> 01:30:38,017
I thought so too, until you mentioned
Pettigrew on the map!

1071
01:30:38,225 --> 01:30:40,898
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!

1072
01:30:41,065 --> 01:30:44,899
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!

1073
01:30:45,345 --> 01:30:49,736
- Me?! He's mental!
- Not you! Your rat!

1074
01:30:50,025 --> 01:30:53,017
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?

1075
01:30:53,185 --> 01:30:55,574
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!

1076
01:30:55,745 --> 01:30:58,213
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?

1077
01:30:58,385 --> 01:31:01,218
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!

1078
01:31:01,425 --> 01:31:04,542
Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!

1079
01:31:04,705 --> 01:31:07,617
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.

1080
01:31:10,105 --> 01:31:13,063
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?

1081
01:31:13,225 --> 01:31:14,260
Scabbers!

1082
01:31:14,425 --> 01:31:17,383
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?

1083
01:31:38,945 --> 01:31:40,697
Remus?

1084
01:31:41,425 --> 01:31:42,858
Sirius.

1085
01:31:43,025 --> 01:31:44,856
My old friends!

1086
01:31:50,265 --> 01:31:53,940
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.

1087
01:31:54,105 --> 01:31:57,620
- James. We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!

1088
01:31:58,425 --> 01:32:00,939
How dare you talk about James
in front of him!

1089
01:32:01,145 --> 01:32:06,139
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!

1090
01:32:06,305 --> 01:32:09,024
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!

1091
01:32:09,225 --> 01:32:11,739
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?

1092
01:32:12,105 --> 01:32:17,463
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!

1093
01:32:19,545 --> 01:32:21,820
James wouldn't have wanted
me killed!

1094
01:32:22,025 --> 01:32:27,463
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!

1095
01:32:27,945 --> 01:32:31,938
Should have realized if Voldemort
didn't kill you, we would. Together!

1096
01:32:32,145 --> 01:32:34,101
No!

1097
01:32:35,545 --> 01:32:39,333
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.

1098
01:32:39,505 --> 01:32:41,336
But we'll take him to the castle.

1099
01:32:41,505 --> 01:32:46,340
- Bless you, boy. Bless you!
- Get off!

1100
01:32:47,465 --> 01:32:49,740
I said we'd take you to the castle.

1101
01:32:50,105 --> 01:32:52,221
After that,
the dementors can have you.

1102
01:32:55,985 --> 01:32:59,580
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.

1103
01:32:59,745 --> 01:33:03,135
A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!

1104
01:33:03,305 --> 01:33:04,784
I was going for the rat.

1105
01:33:04,945 --> 01:33:08,620
Normally, I have a very sweet
disposition as a dog.

1106
01:33:08,785 --> 01:33:13,813
More than once, James suggested
that I make the change permanent.

1107
01:33:13,985 --> 01:33:18,661
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.

1108
01:33:30,705 --> 01:33:32,138
Okay.

1109
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:39,379
- You better go.
- No. Don't worry, okay?

1110
01:33:39,545 --> 01:33:40,898
It's fine. I'll stay.

1111
01:33:41,625 --> 01:33:43,536
You go, I'll stay.

1112
01:33:43,825 --> 01:33:46,817
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Go.

1113
01:33:48,345 --> 01:33:51,223
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.

1114
01:33:51,385 --> 01:33:53,853
They might chop it.

1115
01:33:54,305 --> 01:33:56,865
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.

1116
01:33:57,025 --> 01:34:01,064
It's too late. It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.

1117
01:34:02,265 --> 01:34:04,017
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1118
01:34:04,825 --> 01:34:08,420
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.

1119
01:34:09,105 --> 01:34:12,142
It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.

1120
01:34:14,185 --> 01:34:16,904
That was a noble thing
you did back there.

1121
01:34:17,665 --> 01:34:19,735
He doesn't deserve it.

1122
01:34:19,905 --> 01:34:22,942
I didn't think my dad
would have wanted his best friends...

1123
01:34:23,105 --> 01:34:24,584
...to become killers.

1124
01:34:24,745 --> 01:34:28,294
Besides, dead,
the truth dies with him.

1125
01:34:28,465 --> 01:34:30,740
Alive, you're free.

1126
01:34:30,905 --> 01:34:33,863
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!

1127
01:34:34,065 --> 01:34:37,262
Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me...

1128
01:34:37,425 --> 01:34:39,814
...to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!

1129
01:34:39,985 --> 01:34:43,864
- Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!

1130
01:34:46,225 --> 01:34:48,056
I don't know if you know, Harry...

1131
01:34:48,225 --> 01:34:52,138
...but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godfather.

1132
01:34:52,305 --> 01:34:54,182
I know.

1133
01:34:55,305 --> 01:34:59,184
I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...

1134
01:34:59,345 --> 01:35:01,734
...but if you ever wanted
a different home...

1135
01:35:01,905 --> 01:35:04,294
What? Come and live with you?

1136
01:35:05,545 --> 01:35:08,582
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.

1137
01:35:08,785 --> 01:35:10,264
Harry!

1138
01:35:25,065 --> 01:35:28,580
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?

1139
01:35:29,865 --> 01:35:34,985
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! Here!

1140
01:35:36,265 --> 01:35:38,176
This flesh is only flesh!

1141
01:35:39,305 --> 01:35:41,296
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1142
01:35:50,985 --> 01:35:52,464
Harry!

1143
01:35:53,505 --> 01:35:56,338
Remus! Remus!

1144
01:36:02,305 --> 01:36:04,535
Run! Run!

1145
01:36:14,145 --> 01:36:16,101
- Come on.
- Wait. Wait.

1146
01:36:16,265 --> 01:36:21,134
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

1147
01:36:21,305 --> 01:36:23,455
Professor?

1148
01:36:27,385 --> 01:36:28,864
Professor Lupin?

1149
01:36:36,305 --> 01:36:39,422
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

1150
01:36:39,825 --> 01:36:42,259
There you are, Potter!

1151
01:37:14,665 --> 01:37:15,654
Sirius!

1152
01:37:16,465 --> 01:37:18,774
Come back here, Potter!

1153
01:38:21,905 --> 01:38:23,258
Sirius!

1154
01:38:24,025 --> 01:38:26,858
No. Sirius!

1155
01:39:07,025 --> 01:39:09,778
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

1156
01:41:17,145 --> 01:41:19,420
Harry?

1157
01:41:20,305 --> 01:41:22,580
I saw my dad.

1158
01:41:22,785 --> 01:41:24,264
What?

1159
01:41:24,465 --> 01:41:25,944
He sent the dementors away.

1160
01:41:26,105 --> 01:41:27,458
I saw him across the lake.

1161
01:41:27,625 --> 01:41:29,217
Harry, they've captured Sirius.

1162
01:41:29,425 --> 01:41:32,144
Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.

1163
01:41:32,305 --> 01:41:34,694
- They're gonna kill him?
- No. It's worse.

1164
01:41:34,905 --> 01:41:36,657
Much worse.

1165
01:41:36,825 --> 01:41:39,100
They're going to suck out his soul.

1166
01:41:40,745 --> 01:41:42,064
Headmaster, stop them.

1167
01:41:42,225 --> 01:41:45,456
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true. Sirius is innocent.

1168
01:41:45,625 --> 01:41:47,741
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?

1169
01:41:47,905 --> 01:41:49,224
He's my rat, sir.

1170
01:41:49,625 --> 01:41:53,254
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.

1171
01:41:53,465 --> 01:41:56,980
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.

1172
01:41:57,185 --> 01:41:59,574
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.

1173
01:41:59,785 --> 01:42:04,984
But the word of three 13-year-old
wizards will convince few others.

1174
01:42:07,945 --> 01:42:10,618
A child's voice,
however honest and true...

1175
01:42:10,785 --> 01:42:14,380
...is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.

1176
01:42:19,385 --> 01:42:21,819
Mysterious thing, time.

1177
01:42:22,945 --> 01:42:24,219
Powerful...

1178
01:42:24,385 --> 01:42:27,138
...and when meddled with,
dangerous.

1179
01:42:28,665 --> 01:42:32,135
Sirius Black is in the topmost
cell of the Dark Tower.

1180
01:42:32,905 --> 01:42:34,941
You know the laws, Miss Granger.

1181
01:42:35,105 --> 01:42:36,823
You must not be seen.

1182
01:42:36,985 --> 01:42:40,500
And you would do well, I feel,
to return before this last chime.

1183
01:42:40,665 --> 01:42:44,055
If not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.

1184
01:42:44,585 --> 01:42:46,303
If you succeed tonight...

1185
01:42:46,465 --> 01:42:49,184
...more than one innocent life
may be spared.

1186
01:42:50,945 --> 01:42:53,061
Three turns should do it, I think.

1187
01:42:57,745 --> 01:42:59,497
Oh, and by the way.

1188
01:42:59,665 --> 01:43:05,262
When in doubt, I find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.

1189
01:43:05,425 --> 01:43:07,416
Good luck.

1190
01:43:07,905 --> 01:43:10,260
What the bloody hell
was that all about?

1191
01:43:10,905 --> 01:43:13,135
Sorry, Ron, but seeing
as you can't walk...

1192
01:43:40,945 --> 01:43:42,503
What just happened?

1193
01:43:42,665 --> 01:43:44,860
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.

1194
01:43:45,025 --> 01:43:46,822
Where were we at 7:30?

1195
01:43:46,985 --> 01:43:48,703
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

1196
01:43:48,865 --> 01:43:51,140
Come on. And we can't be seen.

1197
01:43:52,185 --> 01:43:53,937
Hermione!

1198
01:44:11,385 --> 01:44:13,945
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

1199
01:44:15,665 --> 01:44:19,101
Hermione, will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?

1200
01:44:19,305 --> 01:44:22,024
You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

1201
01:44:22,185 --> 01:44:23,459
That's us.

1202
01:44:23,665 --> 01:44:26,463
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.

1203
01:44:26,665 --> 01:44:28,064
This is not normal.

1204
01:44:30,265 --> 01:44:32,540
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

1205
01:44:32,705 --> 01:44:34,821
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

1206
01:44:34,985 --> 01:44:38,182
This is how I've been getting
to my lessons all year.

1207
01:44:38,385 --> 01:44:41,457
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.

1208
01:44:41,625 --> 01:44:44,856
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.

1209
01:44:47,065 --> 01:44:50,102
Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.

1210
01:44:53,105 --> 01:44:54,379
Good punch.

1211
01:44:54,545 --> 01:44:55,978
Thanks.

1212
01:44:56,945 --> 01:44:58,537
Malfoy's coming.

1213
01:44:59,425 --> 01:45:01,655
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

1214
01:45:02,105 --> 01:45:05,063
I'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.

1215
01:45:05,225 --> 01:45:08,979
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

1216
01:45:10,305 --> 01:45:12,773
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

1217
01:45:31,145 --> 01:45:33,579
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

1218
01:45:34,985 --> 01:45:36,782
Of course.

1219
01:45:36,945 --> 01:45:38,856
Remember what Dumbledore said?

1220
01:45:39,025 --> 01:45:42,904
If we succeed, more than one
innocent life could be spared.

1221
01:45:43,265 --> 01:45:44,539
Let's go.

1222
01:46:04,945 --> 01:46:06,981
Here they come. I'd better hurry.

1223
01:46:07,145 --> 01:46:09,534
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.

1224
01:46:09,705 --> 01:46:12,060
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.

1225
01:46:13,065 --> 01:46:15,340
Scabbers, you're alive!

1226
01:46:15,505 --> 01:46:18,178
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.

1227
01:46:18,385 --> 01:46:21,183
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.

1228
01:46:21,345 --> 01:46:24,223
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!

1229
01:46:27,945 --> 01:46:30,539
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.

1230
01:46:30,705 --> 01:46:33,424
If you go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.

1231
01:46:33,585 --> 01:46:36,338
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time.

1232
01:46:36,505 --> 01:46:38,655
We can't be seen.

1233
01:46:41,825 --> 01:46:43,463
Fudge is coming.

1234
01:46:44,345 --> 01:46:46,336
And we aren't leaving?

1235
01:46:48,425 --> 01:46:49,938
Why aren't we leaving?

1236
01:47:00,425 --> 01:47:01,904
Are you mad?

1237
01:47:07,665 --> 01:47:08,984
That hurt.

1238
01:47:09,185 --> 01:47:10,459
Sorry.

1239
01:47:30,465 --> 01:47:33,025
We're coming out the back door. Go!

1240
01:47:49,705 --> 01:47:52,424
Is that really what my hair
looks like from the back?

1241
01:47:54,385 --> 01:47:55,659
What?

1242
01:47:56,505 --> 01:47:58,257
I thought I just saw...

1243
01:47:58,465 --> 01:48:01,025
- Never mind.
- Let's go.

1244
01:48:14,745 --> 01:48:16,940
Okay, go, Harry. Go!

1245
01:48:22,945 --> 01:48:24,822
Get away. Get off.

1246
01:48:46,105 --> 01:48:49,381
Minister, I really think
I should sign as well.

1247
01:48:50,185 --> 01:48:53,222
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...

1248
01:48:53,425 --> 01:48:57,054
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.

1249
01:49:01,345 --> 01:49:03,939
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

1250
01:49:06,225 --> 01:49:09,854
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

1251
01:49:10,665 --> 01:49:13,816
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...

1252
01:49:14,185 --> 01:49:15,823
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

1253
01:49:18,425 --> 01:49:21,258
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.

1254
01:49:21,465 --> 01:49:23,660
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

1255
01:49:26,185 --> 01:49:30,497
- Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister. Follow me.

1256
01:49:30,705 --> 01:49:32,297
- Now, look there.
- Where?

1257
01:49:32,505 --> 01:49:35,736
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?

1258
01:49:35,905 --> 01:49:39,261
Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.

1259
01:49:39,425 --> 01:49:42,144
- Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.

1260
01:49:43,065 --> 01:49:45,818
- Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
- I see no strawberries.

1261
01:49:45,985 --> 01:49:47,100
- Over there.
- Where?

1262
01:49:47,265 --> 01:49:48,937
- Over there.
- This way.

1263
01:49:49,145 --> 01:49:51,705
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.

1264
01:49:53,305 --> 01:49:54,943
But where is it?

1265
01:49:55,825 --> 01:49:57,941
I saw the beast, just now.

1266
01:49:58,545 --> 01:50:00,661
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.

1267
01:50:00,825 --> 01:50:02,099
Buckbeak.

1268
01:50:02,305 --> 01:50:06,218
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.

1269
01:50:06,385 --> 01:50:07,659
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.

1270
01:50:07,865 --> 01:50:11,938
I don't think the minister's suggesting
you had anything to do with this.

1271
01:50:12,145 --> 01:50:14,864
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.

1272
01:50:15,025 --> 01:50:16,822
- Right.
- Well, well.

1273
01:50:16,985 --> 01:50:18,464
We must search the grounds.

1274
01:50:18,625 --> 01:50:21,537
Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.

1275
01:50:21,705 --> 01:50:26,904
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.

1276
01:50:27,065 --> 01:50:30,899
Oh, executioner, your services
are no longer required.

1277
01:50:31,065 --> 01:50:32,862
Thank you.

1278
01:50:33,065 --> 01:50:36,216
You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.

1279
01:50:46,545 --> 01:50:47,978
- Come on.
- This way.

1280
01:50:54,505 --> 01:50:56,223
This way, now.

1281
01:50:58,545 --> 01:51:00,217
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.

1282
01:51:00,425 --> 01:51:02,814
- How?
- No idea.

1283
01:51:11,745 --> 01:51:14,020
- Look. It's Lupin.
- <i>Immobulus!</i>

1284
01:51:20,185 --> 01:51:22,096
And Snape's coming.

1285
01:51:28,065 --> 01:51:29,657
And now we wait.

1286
01:51:30,825 --> 01:51:32,543
And now we wait.

1287
01:51:58,985 --> 01:52:02,102
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.

1288
01:52:04,785 --> 01:52:06,503
- Hermione?
- Yeah?

1289
01:52:06,665 --> 01:52:10,817
Before, down by the lake,
when I was with Sirius...

1290
01:52:10,985 --> 01:52:13,021
...I did see someone.

1291
01:52:13,185 --> 01:52:16,461
That someone
made the dementors go away.

1292
01:52:16,625 --> 01:52:17,899
With a Patronus.

1293
01:52:18,065 --> 01:52:19,896
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

1294
01:52:20,065 --> 01:52:21,464
According to him...

1295
01:52:21,625 --> 01:52:24,901
...only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.

1296
01:52:25,065 --> 01:52:26,862
It was my dad.

1297
01:52:27,945 --> 01:52:29,663
My dad conjured the Patronus.

1298
01:52:29,825 --> 01:52:31,975
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead. I know.

1299
01:52:33,345 --> 01:52:35,575
I'm just telling you what I saw.

1300
01:52:39,545 --> 01:52:41,103
Here we come.

1301
01:52:46,545 --> 01:52:48,820
You see Sirius talking to me there?

1302
01:52:48,985 --> 01:52:51,704
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.

1303
01:52:51,865 --> 01:52:55,062
When we free him, I'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys'.

1304
01:52:55,225 --> 01:52:56,783
It'll just be me and him.

1305
01:52:57,425 --> 01:52:59,302
We could live in the country...

1306
01:52:59,465 --> 01:53:01,979
...someplace you can see the sky.

1307
01:53:02,145 --> 01:53:04,864
He'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.

1308
01:53:05,865 --> 01:53:07,344
Harry!

1309
01:53:08,825 --> 01:53:10,463
Run!

1310
01:53:17,065 --> 01:53:18,544
Let's go.

1311
01:53:37,305 --> 01:53:39,535
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

1312
01:53:43,625 --> 01:53:44,944
Thanks.

1313
01:53:46,705 --> 01:53:50,584
- Great. Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

1314
01:55:02,625 --> 01:55:04,297
That was so scary.

1315
01:55:04,465 --> 01:55:07,298
Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.

1316
01:55:18,265 --> 01:55:21,257
Sirius. Come on!

1317
01:55:36,625 --> 01:55:38,661
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.

1318
01:55:38,825 --> 01:55:41,897
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.

1319
01:55:50,265 --> 01:55:52,017
Any minute now.

1320
01:55:52,225 --> 01:55:54,181
Right there. You'll see.

1321
01:55:55,505 --> 01:55:57,894
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.

1322
01:55:58,065 --> 01:56:00,499
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.

1323
01:56:04,465 --> 01:56:06,820
- Sirius.
- You're dying...

1324
01:56:08,785 --> 01:56:10,582
...both of you.

1325
01:56:12,585 --> 01:56:14,223
Harry!

1326
01:56:16,065 --> 01:56:19,774
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

1327
01:57:15,985 --> 01:57:17,498
You were right, Hermione.

1328
01:57:17,665 --> 01:57:20,862
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!

1329
01:57:21,025 --> 01:57:23,664
I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.

1330
01:57:23,825 --> 01:57:26,100
I knew I could do it
this time because...

1331
01:57:26,265 --> 01:57:27,903
...well, I had already done it.

1332
01:57:28,065 --> 01:57:30,420
- Does that make sense?
- No.

1333
01:57:30,585 --> 01:57:33,304
But I don't like flying...!

1334
01:57:45,905 --> 01:57:47,179
<i>Bombarda!</i>

1335
01:58:19,145 --> 01:58:21,818
I'll be forever grateful for this...

1336
01:58:21,985 --> 01:58:23,259
...to both of you.

1337
01:58:23,425 --> 01:58:26,223
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.

1338
01:58:26,385 --> 01:58:29,183
For some time, my life
will be too unpredictable.

1339
01:58:29,345 --> 01:58:31,017
And besides...

1340
01:58:31,905 --> 01:58:35,056
...you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.

1341
01:58:35,225 --> 01:58:37,261
And you know it.

1342
01:58:38,305 --> 01:58:40,102
And for now, that will do.

1343
01:58:42,345 --> 01:58:44,779
I expect you're tired of hearing this...

1344
01:58:45,745 --> 01:58:48,179
...but you look so like your father.

1345
01:58:49,865 --> 01:58:51,742
Except your eyes.

1346
01:58:52,665 --> 01:58:54,860
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.

1347
01:58:56,745 --> 01:59:01,614
It's cruel that I spent so much time
with James and Lily, and you so little.

1348
01:59:02,185 --> 01:59:03,618
But know this:

1349
01:59:04,705 --> 01:59:07,742
The ones that love us
never really leave us.

1350
01:59:09,065 --> 01:59:10,942
And you can always find them...

1351
01:59:13,225 --> 01:59:15,022
...in here.

1352
01:59:24,985 --> 01:59:27,419
You really are the brightest
witch of your age.

1353
01:59:53,145 --> 01:59:54,703
We have to go.

1354
02:00:21,825 --> 02:00:24,385
- Well?
- He's free. We did it.

1355
02:00:24,545 --> 02:00:26,024
Did what?

1356
02:00:26,185 --> 02:00:28,062
Good night.

1357
02:00:36,465 --> 02:00:37,739
How did you get there?

1358
02:00:37,905 --> 02:00:40,465
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.

1359
02:00:40,785 --> 02:00:43,299
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.

1360
02:00:43,465 --> 02:00:46,855
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?

1361
02:01:12,265 --> 02:01:13,698
Hello, Harry.

1362
02:01:17,185 --> 02:01:18,937
I saw you coming.

1363
02:01:23,305 --> 02:01:25,899
I've looked worse, believe me.

1364
02:01:28,505 --> 02:01:31,542
- You've been sacked.
- No.

1365
02:01:31,705 --> 02:01:34,538
No. I resigned, actually.

1366
02:01:34,705 --> 02:01:36,423
Resigned? Why?

1367
02:01:36,585 --> 02:01:41,659
Well, it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.

1368
02:01:41,825 --> 02:01:47,104
This time tomorrow, the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want...

1369
02:01:47,265 --> 02:01:50,496
...well, someone like me
teaching their children.

1370
02:01:50,705 --> 02:01:52,536
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already...

1371
02:01:52,705 --> 02:01:54,502
...risked enough on my behalf.

1372
02:01:54,665 --> 02:01:57,782
Besides, people like me are...

1373
02:01:58,385 --> 02:02:01,582
Well, let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.

1374
02:02:10,745 --> 02:02:13,213
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

1375
02:02:13,385 --> 02:02:15,455
None of it made any difference.

1376
02:02:15,625 --> 02:02:19,015
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?

1377
02:02:19,185 --> 02:02:22,541
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.

1378
02:02:22,705 --> 02:02:25,094
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.

1379
02:02:25,465 --> 02:02:27,854
It made a great deal of difference.

1380
02:02:32,305 --> 02:02:34,421
If I am proud of anything...

1381
02:02:34,585 --> 02:02:37,145
...it is of how much
you have learned this year.

1382
02:02:37,305 --> 02:02:39,944
Now, since I am no longer
your teacher...

1383
02:02:40,105 --> 02:02:44,178
...I feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.

1384
02:02:45,065 --> 02:02:47,454
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.

1385
02:02:47,625 --> 02:02:50,093
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

1386
02:02:50,625 --> 02:02:51,899
Until then...

1387
02:02:53,185 --> 02:02:54,823
...mischief managed.

1388
02:03:27,665 --> 02:03:31,704
Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.

1389
02:03:31,865 --> 02:03:33,218
Harry.

1390
02:03:34,025 --> 02:03:35,344
Wherever did you get it?

1391
02:03:35,505 --> 02:03:37,814
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.

1392
02:03:37,985 --> 02:03:40,055
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.

1393
02:03:40,225 --> 02:03:43,376
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.

1394
02:03:43,545 --> 02:03:45,934
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.

1395
02:03:46,105 --> 02:03:47,538
Did not.

1396
02:03:48,865 --> 02:03:52,221
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.

1397
02:03:52,385 --> 02:03:53,864
For me?

1398
02:03:54,025 --> 02:03:56,459
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.

1399
02:03:56,625 --> 02:03:58,456
This came with it.

1400
02:04:03,105 --> 02:04:04,697
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.

1401
02:04:04,865 --> 02:04:06,617
How fast is it, Harry?

1402
02:04:25,185 --> 02:04:26,743
Lumos.

1403
02:04:26,905 --> 02:04:29,214
<i>I solemnly swear that I am</i>
<i>up to no good.</i>

1404
02:15:20,585 --> 02:15:22,303
<i>Mischief managed.</i>

1405
02:15:27,825 --> 02:15:29,224
<i>Nox.</i>
